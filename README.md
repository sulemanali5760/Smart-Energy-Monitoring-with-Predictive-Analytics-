KPIs displayed:  
- Current Load (kWh)  
- Forecasted Load (next 24h)  
- Anomaly Alerts  
- Daily Peak vs Average Usage  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Prophet)  
- **Matplotlib / Plotly** for visualization  
- **Streamlit / Dash** for dashboard interface  
- **Git** for version control
